# Balzac

Balzac is a simple, beautiful theme for Anchor. Free to all, just attribute where appropriate.

It is fluid & responsive theme. It's gloriously beautiful and suited to long form. Built on a SCSS foundation, it's pretty organized (not perfect, still cleaning it up a bit). 

This is built on Semantic.gs grid framework which I edited a bit to make it fluid. It utilized much of the PHP from my own blog, which forked and customized the PHP from Zleek (Josh Kennedy). 

You can now also dictate the color of the nav links just like in the Jekyll version! By creating a text variable for both your pages and articles, you can denote "darken" to darken the navigation links up top.*
