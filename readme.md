# Balzac

Balzac is a simple, beautiful theme for Anchor. 

Free to all, just attribute where appropriate.

Balzac is a new, fluid & responsive theme for Anchor. It's gloriously beautiful and suited to long form. Built on a SCSS foundation, it's organized and awesome.

This is built on Semantic.gs grid framework which I edited a bit to make it fluid. It utilized much of the PHP from my own blog, which forked and customized the PHP from Zleek (Josh Kennedy).
